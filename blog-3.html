It is also a method of business that can be automated and reused over and over again. Some businesses will have a more difficult road towards product creation than others. The best products come from thinking of what you can do that helps your customers without needing in-person assistance. For example, if you own a restaurant look into making a cookbook or possibly some kind of special spice mix. In contrast, if you own a highly specialized service business then consider offering helpful DIY guides and resources. This method of marketing products can open new avenues of income that might have never been available before COVID.
       <br><br>
        <b>2. Open Your Store Online</b>
        <br><br>

        <b>3. Create Free Online Content</b>
        <br><br>
        Every business, no matter the service or product, can benefit from creating content for their target customers.

        <br><br>
        Every business owner knows a lot about their craft, if they did not then they would not be in business. Why not condense that knowledge and put it into prepackaged course that can be sold back to the customers? The internet is full of little bits of information, but courses go beyond all of that by offering comprehensive guides that cover all parts of a subject and leave the student with a much better understanding.This is a great way to build connections and reach customers you might not have had the chance to connect with before. Creating a standalone course does not take much equipment or initial investment, just a smartphone, some lighting, and a mic. With only a hundred dollars or so you could get started creating your course today.Courses are also a great way to maximize your time. Instead of answering individual questions you can bundle your knowledge together and create a course that you can sell at any time without any additional investment required.Some great examples of online courses different businesses could make:Restaurant – how to cook some of our best dishes at homeRunning event – The step by step guide to preparing for a marathonClothing company – Creating the style of your dreams – How to put together jaw-dropping outfits

        <b>5. Live Online Classes and Services</b>
        <br><br>
        If you normally offer in-person classes / services then this is a good time to find a way to offer those same services online. For example, many educational classes could be done just as easily online as they could in person. Even many sports or extracurricular activities could also be reframed to be taught from behind a screen. This could be a good way to add in another service for those who are unable to leave their homes.Online classes are different than courses because they need to be filmed live while working with your customers. Classes cannot be prerecorded in the same way that many courses can be made.
